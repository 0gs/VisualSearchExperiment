# Visual Search Experiment
This repository is for the bachelor thesis focused on a visual search experiment.

The goal of the qualification work is to develop an interactive visual search experiment that runs entirely in the browser, using JavaScript and the jsPsych framework. The system allows participants to complete visual search tasks of varying difficulty—defined by grid size, distractor color complexity, and rotated shape interference. A calibration phase is included to measure each participant’s baseline reaction time for better normalization and cross-device comparison. All results are collected in real-time, enabling large-scale online testing without the need for specialized hardware.

The project is part of a Bachelor thesis at the Faculty of Computing, University of Latvia.
